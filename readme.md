# DistanceForumula
generates random plot points (x, y) and (x2, y2) then calculates the distance between them </br>

Q: but why do it when theres already out there, Jeraldy? </br>
</br>
A: I was watching a TV series and suddently a scene pop up that presented a picture of a triangle. It reminded me of geometry and the hypotenuse of a triangle (idk why). In my mind, I was figuring out if you can find the hypotenuse (3rd side length) using only 2 side lengths. Ah, brain fart happen..It was the pythagoream theorem after searching on google. It then lead me to Cordinates and Planes and eventually distance forumla. As a fellow geek computer fantatic teenager who makes scramble javascript code, i wanna see how rusty i really am when writing easy code. Turns out this Q&A took longer than writing a Distance Forumla javaS code. Which is good.
